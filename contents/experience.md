- Designed **L-CRAQ**, an improved cyclic chain replication protocol based on CRAQ, introducing a metadata node and transforming the linear structure into a cyclic topology to support multi-node writes while preserving high read performance.  
- Enhanced system write flexibility and throughput, addressing the limitations of single-writer CRAQ by enabling concurrent write operations across replicas.  
- Conducted in-depth performance evaluation of Paxos, Raft, CRAQ, and L-CRAQ under varying network latency conditions, offering insights into protocol selection and optimization for distributed consistency systems.
