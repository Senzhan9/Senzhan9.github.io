Designed L-CRAQ, an enhanced cyclic chain replication protocol that transforms CRAQ’s linear structure into a cyclic topology by introducing a metadata node, enabling multi-node concurrent writes while preserving high read performance. This improvement overcomes CRAQ’s single-writer limitation, significantly increasing write flexibility and throughput.
